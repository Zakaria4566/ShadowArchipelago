# Data

This directory contains data files used by or generated by the scripts.

-   `/processed`: Contains intermediate or final data files generated by the pipeline.
    -   `candidate_genes.txt`: The list of genes associated with the discovered archipelago islands.
-   `/external`: This is where large, external datasets should be placed (e.g., the hg38 genome fasta file). These files are not tracked by Git.
